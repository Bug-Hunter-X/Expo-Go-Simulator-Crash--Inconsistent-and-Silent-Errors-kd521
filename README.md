This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in the Expo Go simulator resulting in inconsistent crashes without helpful error messages. The app functions correctly on physical devices.  The bug and its solution are included for illustrative purposes.  The solution involves more robust error handling and logging to identify the root cause of the crashes, which were ultimately found to be related to an asynchronous operation that failed silently in the simulator environment.

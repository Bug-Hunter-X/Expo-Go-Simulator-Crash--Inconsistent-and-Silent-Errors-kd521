While developing an Expo app, I encountered an unusual error where the app crashed without providing a clear error message in the Expo Go client or the console.  The app functioned correctly when run on a physical device but failed on the Expo Go simulator. The error was inconsistent, sometimes crashing immediately on launch and other times after a few interactions. I tried standard debugging techniques like console logs and error handling without success because no clear error message was being generated.
